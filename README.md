Hi, I’m rwyhai.

I'm intending to have a variety of projects on here geared towards security and practicing Python.  
I’m currently working towards my eJPT certification as well as finishing up my degree at WGU.  
If you see something interesting on here don't hesitate to reach out. 

You can reach me at rwhi566@wgu.edu or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-white-458394231/
